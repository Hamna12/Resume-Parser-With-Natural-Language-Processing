Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements\\nunder each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently\\ngraduated with a bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree, those who are staying within the same career field,\\nand candidates with few time gaps in their job history.

Resume Purpose, Design, &amp; Mechanics\\nThe purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,\\nand skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,\\nthink of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect\\ncandidate for the opportunity at hand.\\nResume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best\\npractices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content\\nand a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with\\nregard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify\\nthe skills you possess and employers are seeking.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should\\nkeep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing\\nelements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the reader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye to rest.\\nUsing .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A\\n10-12 point font size is recommended.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold\\na job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,\\ndates, etc. line up neatly on the page.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully\\nread through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least\\n2-3 people proofread it as well.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when\\nyou have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,\\nquantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry\\nor job function-specific) and transferable skills.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the\\nskill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily\\nscan your resume for what he or she is seeking.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is\\nassumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy duties included...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy responsibilities\\nwere\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.\\nAlso, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your\\nmost important information stands out.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cII.

Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements\\nunder each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently\\ngraduated with a bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree, those who are staying within the same career field,\\nand candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred\\nby employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and\\nclearly ties candidates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 skills and accomplishments to their work histories.\\n\\nV.\\n\\nFunctional & Combination Resume Samples...\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6..Pages 12-13\\nThis format is an option for candidates who have changed employers frequently,\\nhave gaps in their employment history, or are hoping to transition to a new industry\\nor unrelated job function.

Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics\\nThe purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,\\nand skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,\\nthink of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect\\ncandidate for the opportunity at hand.\\nResume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best\\npractices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content\\nand a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with\\nregard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify\\nthe skills you possess and employers are seeking.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should\\nkeep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing\\nelements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the reader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye to rest.\\nUsing .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A\\n10-12 point font size is recommended.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold\\na job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,\\ndates, etc. line up neatly on the page.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully\\nread through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least\\n2-3 people proofread it as well.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when\\nyou have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,\\nquantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry\\nor job function-specific) and transferable skills.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the\\nskill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily\\nscan your resume for what he or she is seeking.\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is\\nassumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy duties included...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy responsibilities\\nwere\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xef\\x81\\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.\\nAlso, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your\\nmost important information stands out.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cII.

Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or\\nmore skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.\\nConsider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?\\nWhat were your accomplishments?
